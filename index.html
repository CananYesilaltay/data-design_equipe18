            <h1>Is dark chocolate better for you than milk chocolate? </h1>
            <p>As the effects of the COVID-19 crisis continue to make themselves felt, how do we answer the many health questions raised by citizens and make space for scientific information that is useful in everyday life?</p>
            <p>And many scientists have been trying for years to remedy this false information that is continuously circulating in our society.</p>
            <p>With this quiz, we try to make people aware of the fake news that have been circulating in our daily life for decades (who knows, hundreds of years!)</p>
            <p>So good luck for this test ;) </p>
