                <p>That benefit needs to be put into context because aspirin is not without its side effects. Nevertheless, we are rating this as satisfactory despite the use of relative risk based, because it did not trumpet the relative risk reductions and emphasized the uncertainties and limitations of the study results. In contrast to some other stories we reviewed, from the lead sentence through the body of the story, it is clear that aspirin increases the risk of bleeding ulcers and other bleeding problems. The story includes a description of the key features of the study, noting that the researchers re-analyzed data from several experiments that compared the heart disease outcomes of people randomly assigned to take aspirin daily to those who were given placebo pills, and that the researchers then added in data from death records in order to asses long-term cancer death rates. The story highlights concerns about relying on data gathered to look at one health threat (heart disease) in order to draw conclusions about a completely different health threat (cancer). It is difficult to mention cancer and not fall victim to disease mongering. Few other disease provide a similar emotional response.<br/><br/></p>
