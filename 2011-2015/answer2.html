                <p>Although the article does not specify the absolute number of children who improved after surgery compared with the control group, the article gives readers enough information to understand the measured benefits.

Seventy-seven percent of the children were seizure-free one year after surgery, compared with seven percent in a control group of children who received medical treatment alone while waiting for surgery<br/><br/></p>
